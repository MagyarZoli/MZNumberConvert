MZNumberConvert

Hungarian number translation

This program converts the requested number into its Hungarian word representation using the defined rules and mappings.
The program first defines the mappings places.
The conversion function then breaks the number into groups of three digits and converts each group separately,
appending the corresponding place to each group as necessary. 
Finally, the converted words for each group are combined and returned as a single string.
 - `number` number you want to convert
 - `language`  language selection, according to which spelling rules to convert the number
